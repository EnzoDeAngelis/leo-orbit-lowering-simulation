# LEO Orbit Lowering Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based simulation framework developed for the analysis of low-Earth-orbit missions under atmospheric drag.

## Overview
The project focuses on the numerical propagation of spacecraft dynamics and the investigation of orbit-lowering strategies driven by aerodynamic drag effects.

## Features
- Orbital propagation in Earth-centered inertial frames
- Atmospheric drag modeling
- Numerical integration of spacecraft equations of motion
- Long-term orbit decay analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Context
This project was developed as part of a Master’s thesis in Aerospace Engineering.

## Status
Ongoing / Academic project
